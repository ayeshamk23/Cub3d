# 🕹️ Cub3D

> A first-person 3D renderer using raycasting — inspired by Wolfenstein 3D and powered by C and MiniLibX.

## 📌 Description

**Cub3D** is a 42 School project that challenges students to build a simple 3D engine using raycasting. The player explores a world rendered from a 2D map, with textured walls, real-time movement, and collision detection — all without using any external game engine.

But for me, this project became something more personal.

## 🎨 Personal Touch

I truly enjoyed working on Cub3D because I used it as an opportunity to **turn the in-game walls into an art gallery** — featuring my **own original artworks** as textures! Framing my art within the digital space I built from scratch was both surreal and incredibly fulfilling. It felt like coding a canvas, and every hallway became a piece of interactive storytelling.

## 🎮 Features

- Raycasting-based 3D rendering from a 2D map
- Real-time movement, rotation, and collision detection
- Wall textures and sky/floor coloring
- Minimap overlay (optional)
- Custom map parsing from `.cub` files
- Keyboard controls for movement and escape

## 🕹️ Controls

- `W` / `↑` – Move forward  
- `S` / `↓` – Move backward  
- `A` – Strafe left  
- `D` – Strafe right  
- `←` / `→` – Rotate view  
- `ESC` – Exit game

## 🚀 Run the Project

```bash
make
./cub3D maps/ayeshamk.cub
```

## 📘 Concepts Learned

- Raycasting and line-of-sight rendering
- Grid-based movement and collision handling
- Texture mapping and perspective projection
- Parsing and validating custom map formats
- Low-level graphics programming with MiniLibX
- Clean code architecture and real-time input handling
